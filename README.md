# physical-modelling-synthesis (Karplusplus)

A first-principles implementation of physical modelling synthesis using Web Audio API with an interactive Audio graph.


## Instructions
The master branch version of the webapp is automatically published to this repo's Github pages: 
To modify code or use other branches, simply clone a branch and open docs/index.html in a browser.

The end goal of the project is a visual audio sandbox that makes experimentation with physical modelling easy and is capable of replicating classic simple examples of the Karplus Strong algorithm to generate string plucks and drum hits.

## [oCanvas](http://ocanvas.org/)

The interactive graph is implemented with oCanvas, an object-oriented Canvas wrapper. The development version is included in this repo.
